# DotFiles - Michael Tennant
I recently made a fresh linux install (I use Arch BTW), and so I needed to rewrite my dotfiles and config files. Due to poor choices involving shoddy backups on shoddy drives, I figured it would be best to upload them to github to allow me to access these files anywhere I am. And as an added benifit I get to share my dotfiles to the eternal void that is the internet and brag about using Arch (I use Arch BTW).

Note that these dotfiles and configuration files have been written for my own personal use and so may not work for other machines. Nor are they in any way complete.
